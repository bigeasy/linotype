# Linotype

A template driven CMS for Node.js.

 * Low cost to run, like PHP, it can be hosted on a multi-tenant system.
 * Has to be multi-tenant built in, so someone can choose to build a Linotype
   site, host it in their own Linotype instance.
 * RDBMS, because you want to be able to manage your data independedant of an
   application. But, that does break down. But, RDBMS is cheap.
